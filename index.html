    <h1>NBA Player Stats Analysis</h1>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> Understanding NBA player performance is essential for evaluating 
      individual contributions and their overall impact on the game. This
     analysis uses statistical data from the official NBA website's leaderboard 
      to explore key performance metrics such as points, assists, and rebounds. 
     These statistics serve as critical indicators of player efficiency, influencing 
     decisions made by fans, analysts, and team managers alike. </p>

    <p> Analyzing player performance metrics provides valuable insights into a player's 
     strengths and weaknesses, helping predict future performance and enabling 
      data-driven decisions regarding player contracts, trades, and team compositions. 
      As professional sports increasingly embrace analytics, particularly in leagues 
     like the NBA, this project offers a deep dive into the world of sports analytics 
     by examining player performance through quantitative metrics.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>
          
    <p> Our analysis makes use of a dataset from the NBA stats leaders, and it includes the 
        top-performing players across various categories such as points per game, assists, 
        rebounds, steals, and blocks starting from 2010 and after. This data contains 
       roughly 450 records and includes around 22 key attributes. The attributes are listed 
       in the following table:</p>

        <h3>Correlation Heatmap</h3>
        <div id="heatmap" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>
        <p>
        The heatmap reveals significant relationships among key basketball metrics. 
        High correlations, such as those between height and weight, and between offensive stats like points and usage percentage, 
        show logical connections in player attributes and performance. Negative correlations, like the one between draft year and player
         age, highlight older players being drafted earlier historically. 
         Metrics like net rating exhibit weak correlations with most variables, reflecting its lack of usefulness. Red colors signify 
         a strong positive positive correlation, whereas blue colors signify a weaker correlation between two variables(1 to -1 being 
         positively strong and negatively strong relationnships, respectively)
        </p>

        <label for="teamSelect">Select Team:</label>
        <div id="dropdown"></div>
        <div id="chart"></div>
        <div id="tooltip" style="position: absolute; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; visibility: hidden; pointer-events: none;"></div>

        <h3>Shooting Efficiency by Draft Round</h3>
        <p>This chart shows the shooting efficiency of players categorized by draft rounds...</p>
        <div id="shootingEfficiency" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>
        <p>
          Players drafted in earlier rounds (1-4) exhibit a gradual decrease in shooting efficiency, with round 4 
          having the lowest performance. Surprisingly, later rounds (5-8) show a significant increase in efficiency, 
          possibly reflecting a focus on specialized skills or higher motivation among players trying to prove their worth. 
          These could also be drafs for veteran players worth significant value, Like James Harden for example. Undrafted players 
          demonstrate consistent but moderate efficiency, showcasing a stable contribution despite not being selected in the drafts.
          These players tend to be free agents, menaing that they are not contracted to play for a certain team, and can freely join
          any teams.
