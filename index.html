    <h1>NBA Player Stats Analysis</h1>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> Understanding NBA player performance is essential for evaluating 
      individual contributions and their overall impact on the game. This
     analysis uses statistical data from the official NBA website's leaderboard 
      to explore key performance metrics such as points, assists, and rebounds. 
     These statistics serve as critical indicators of player efficiency, influencing 
     decisions made by fans, analysts, and team managers alike. </p>

    <p> Analyzing player performance metrics provides valuable insights into a player's 
     strengths and weaknesses, helping predict future performance and enabling 
      data-driven decisions regarding player contracts, trades, and team compositions. 
      As professional sports increasingly embrace analytics, particularly in leagues 
     like the NBA, this project offers a deep dive into the world of sports analytics 
     by examining player performance through quantitative metrics.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>
          
    <p> Our analysis makes use of a dataset from the NBA stats leaders, and it includes the 
        top-performing players across various categories such as points per game, assists, 
        rebounds, steals, and blocks starting from 2010 and after. This data contains 
       roughly 450 records and includes around 22 key attributes. The attributes are listed 
       in the following table:</p>

        <h3>Correlation Heatmap</h3>
        <div id="heatmap" style="width: 100%; height: 50px;"></div>
        <img src="correlation_heatmap.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap">
        <p>
          The heatmap reveals significant relationships among key basketball metrics and draft-related attributes. 
          Positive correlations, such as those between height and weight, and between offensive statistics like points per game, 
          usage percentage, and true shooting percentage, show logical connections between a player’s physical attributes and their 
          scoring contributions. Rebounding also correlates positively with height and weight, reflecting the advantage of size in 
          rebounding effectiveness. Negative correlations, like the one between draft year and age, highlight the trend of younger
           players being drafted earlier. Metrics such as net rating exhibit weak correlations with most variables, indicating that 
           individual player performance does not always align strongly with team success. Red colors signify strong positive 
           relationships, while blue colors indicate negative correlations, ranging from 1 to -1 in strength.

        <h3>Metrics Across Seasons: Total points, rebounds, and assists</h3>
        <label for="teamSelect">Select Team:</label>
        <div id="dropdown"></div>
        <div id="chart"></div>
        <div id="tooltip" style="position: absolute; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; visibility: hidden; pointer-events: none;"></div>
    <p>
        This interactive chart allows users to select an NBA team from a dropdown menu to view its total points (Pts), rebounds (Reb), and assists (Ast) for a given season. 
        By updating based on the selected team, the chart provides a clear breakdown of performance across these key metrics. 
        It offers insights into a team’s strengths, such as whether they excel in scoring, rebounding, or facilitating play. 
        Additionally, the chart can be used to compare teams, highlighting differences in play style and performance. For example, it may show if a team focuses more on offense (points), dominates defensively (rebounds), or emphasizes ball movement and teamwork (assists). 
        This tool is useful for fans, analysts, and coaches seeking to understand team dynamics, identify patterns, and evaluate performance trends over multiple seasons. 
    <p>

        <h3>Shooting Efficiency by Draft Round</h3>
        <p>This chart shows the shooting efficiency of players categorized by draft rounds...</p>
        <img src="shooting_efficiency.png" alt="Shooting Efficiency by Draft Round">
        <div id="shootingEfficiency" style="width: 100%; height: 50px;"></div>
        <p>
          The box plot highlights shooting efficiency (true shooting percentage) categorized by draft round, revealing trends 
          in player performance based on draft position. Players selected in the first round display consistent shooting efficiency, 
          with a narrow range and fewer outliers, indicating their reliability as scorers. Second-round picks, on the other hand, 
          show greater variability, with some high-performing outliers suggesting potential undervaluation during the draft process. 
          Undrafted players exhibit steady but slightly lower efficiency compared to first-round picks, showcasing their ability to 
          contribute consistently despite not being selected. This chart illustrates the relationship between draft round and scoring 
          efficiency, emphasizing how earlier draft picks tend to perform more reliably, while later picks and undrafted players 
          demonstrate greater performance variability.

        <h3>Team and Player Selection</h3>
        <p> Understanding NBA player performance is essential for evaluating individual contributions and their overall 
            impact on the game. This analysis uses statistical data from the official NBA website's leaderboard to 
            explore key performance metrics such as points, assists, and rebounds. These statistics serve as critical 
            indicators of player efficiency, influencing decisions made by fans, analysts, and team managers alike. 
            In order to better evaluate the player stats, below are interactive charts that allow for user to select
